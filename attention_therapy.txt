Parenting skills training (behavioral parent management training) teaches parents the skills they need to encourage and reward positive behaviors in their children. It helps parents learn how to use a system of rewards and consequences to change a child’s behavior. Parents are taught to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want to encourage, and ignore or redirect behaviors that they want to discourage. They may also learn to structure situations in ways that support desired behavior.



\n\n\nParents and teachers can help kids with ADHD stay organized and follow directions with tools such as:

    \n\n\t\t1.\tKeeping a routine and a schedule. Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. Include times for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the schedule on the refrigerator or on a bulletin board in the kitchen. Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible.
    
    \n\n\t\t2.\tOrganizing everyday items. Have a place for everything, and keep everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and toys.
    
    \n\n\t\t3.\tUsing homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home the necessary books.
    
    \n\n\t\t4.\tBeing clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they can understand and follow.
    
    \n\n\t\t5.\tGiving praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior, and praise it.
